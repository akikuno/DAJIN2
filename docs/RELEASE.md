# Current Release

# v0.5.3 (2024-XX-XX)

## üí• Breaking

- Update `clustering.clustering`: Use Constrained Kmeans clustering to address the issue of cluster imbalance where extremely minor clusters were preferentially separated. Set `min_cluster_size` to 0.5% of the sample read count. [[Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/c1b14e73d8a95fdb39e510a7a90e501d596b7f3a)]
  - As a result, `clustering.label_merger.py` is no longer needed and has been removed.



- Update `consensus.call_consensus`: For mutations determined to be sequence errors, we previously replaced them with unknown (`N`), but this `N` had low interpretability. Therefore, mutations that DAJIN2 determines to be sequence errors will now be assigned the same base as the reference genome. [[Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/1f46215ae7054c4da088c638ad82e41dd0dc7227)]



## üêõ Bug Fixes

- Due to a bias in `classifiler.calc_match` where alleles with shorter sequences were prioritized, the operation of dividing by sequence length has been removed. [[Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/fa6fbd5a7f9693df3b067a3041df42198a0d65b7)]


- Fix `preporcess.mapping.generate_sam` to perform alignments with `map-ont` and `splice` in addition to `sr` for sequence lengths of 500 bp or less, and select the optimal prefix from these alignments. Issue: #45 [[Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/9e7fb93f3c7b74095d2afd08bf3fa0bc00e6f367)]

## üí• Breaking

+ Extremely low-frequency alleles (less than 0.05%) are considered Nanopore sequence errors and are not clustered #36.
  + Configure `clustering.extract_labels` so that alleles with a low number of reads (0.05% or fewer or 5 reads or fewer) are not clustered. [[Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/e671b5c84b4cf522faf51823e36fe075b049efcf)]
  + Change `clustering.clustering` to stop if the minimum value of the elements in the cluster is 0.5% or less. [[Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/74609d5048a4ad8d7004886bf411b2ed4be7fa4b)]

  + Fix `extract_unique_insertions`: There is a bug where removing the key twice in fasta_insertions_unique caused the index and key to become misaligned in enumerate(distances) if i != key. Therefore, the removal of keys from fasta_insertions_unique is now done all at once at the end. [[Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/162f248b4deee8c35512b84ec428baec65fd8466)]

## üí• Breaking

+ Update the log file [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/f179c264193391e27f16c66d0f0153f8ae366005)
  + Add the version of DAJIN2 to the log file to track the version of the analysis.
  + Rename the log file to `DAJIN2_log_<current time>.txt` from `<current time>_DAJIN2.log` to enabling open the file in any text editor.

+ Update `mutation_extractor.is_dissimilar_loci` [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/2e141bfbbf41a8fe72d11acf159e1974143b7f4e)
  - Rename to `is_dissimilar_loci` from `identify_dissimilar_loci` to explicitly indicate that a boolean is returned.
  - Changed to use cosine distance instead of cosine similarity to make "difference from control" more intuitive.
  - Added a condition to ensure that the cosine distance is not dependent on the specific index: Calculate the cosine distance for 10 bases starting from the neighbor of the corresponding indel, and add the condition that the cosine distances of these adjacent 10 bases should be similar.

+ Update `preprocess.insertions_to_fasta.py` which detects unintended insertion alleles. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/d8bbd9f50b163b6099a5e77c9f7f4de2f5fc08f7)
  + `clustering_insertions`: To accelerate MeanShift clustering, set `bin_seeding=True`. Additionally, because clustering decoys without variation becomes extremely slow, we have switched to using decoys that include slight variations.
  + `extract_unique_insertions`: Within `unintended insertion alleles`, alleles similar to the `intended allele` provided by the user are now excluded.
    + The similarity is defined as there being differences of more than 10 bases

+ Update `preprocess.insertions_to_fasta.clustering_insertions` to consider the length of each insertion sequence during clustering. This allows two alleles, such as `N,(30-base Insertion)` and `(30-base Insertion),N`, to be weighted with different scores as [(1, 30), (30, 1)], enabling correct clustering. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/d41617d8386aa2a4f057cf44c293a1097fa146b6)

+ Update `preprocess.homopolymer_handler`: Scaling data to [0, 1] for cosine similarity, normalizing to match scales due to significant differences in mutation rates between samples and controls. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/0ad27ca2fa7a12ce0cb80e938bc55c903113018f)

## üöÄ Performance

+ Update `consensus.similarity_searcher` to cache onehot encoded controls to avoid redundant computations and increase processing speed. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/0f96c69099cf97e2f4f5a795e224a887c4c667f9)

## üêõ Bug Fixes

+ Debug `clustering.strand_bias_handler` [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/33e955f4afbfa5c30e3494ee97d1fffe33769778)
  + For `positive_strand_counts_by_labels: dict`, there was a bug that caused an error and halted execution when accessing a non-existent key. It has been fixed to output 0 instead.
  + Created a wrapper function `annotate_strand_bias_by_labels` for outputting strand bias. Fixed a bug where the second and subsequent arguments were not being correctly passed when reallocating clusters with strand bias.

+ Fix `preprocess.knockin_handler` to correctly identify the flox knock-in sites as deletions not present in the control.  [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/d4d267c99f8c51d3a3f88f67882bead66685f710)

+ Bug fix and update `reallocate_insertion_within_deletion` [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/2f356546999f645a8cb8d33a1fc2f64bc6742113)
  - In the script that considers the region between two deletions as an insertion sequence, the size of the other deletion was not taken into account. Even if there was a single base deletion, the entire sequence between the deletions was considered as an insertion sequence. 
  - Therefore, the region between two deletions is now defined as (1) identifying bins where deletions are enriched within appropriate bins (500 bp) continuously, and (2) extracting the precise break points from the start and end of these bins, implementing an algorithm to extract the large deletion region.

<summary> v0.4.1 (2024-02-13) </summary>

## üìù Documentation

- Added documentation for a new feature in `README.md`: DAJIN2 can now detect complex mutations characteristic of genome editing, such as insertions occurring in regions where deletions have occurred.

## üöÄ New Features

- Introduced `cssplits_handler.detect_insertion_within_deletion` to extract insertion sequences within deletions. This addresses cases where minimap2 may align bases that partially match the reference through local alignment, potentially failing to detect them as insertions. This enhancement ensures the proper detection of insertion sequences. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/7651e20852b94ed4d5bb38539bb56229dcc8b763)

- Added `report.insertion_refractor.py` to include original insertion information in the consensus for mappings made by insertion. This addition enables the listing of both insertions and deletions within the insertion allele on a single HTML file. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/e6c3b636bb2ba537d1341d1042341afd6583dd0b)

## üîß Maintenance

- Updated `insertions_to_fasta.py`. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/7927feb0bb4f3091537aaebabd60a441456a3413)
  - Modified the approach to reduce randomness by replacing set or frozenset with list or tuple, and using `random.sample()` for subsetting reads.
  - Refactored `call_consensus_insertion_sequence`.
  - Fixed a bug in `extract_score_and_sequence` to ensure correct appending of scores for the insertions_merged_subset.

- Changed the function name of `report` to be more explicit. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/93132c5beba17278c7d67b76817bb13dfaae57a3)

- Updated `utils.report_report_generator` [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/821f06f05b5ed2f4ba2d7baad6159d774d2e5db0)
  - Capitalized "Allele" (e.g., control) and "Allele type" (e.g., intact).
  - Changed the output format of read_all and read_summary from CSV to XLSX.
  - Corrected the order of the Legend to follow a logical sequence from control to sample, and then to specific insertions.

- Updated `utils.io.read_xlsx` to switch from using pandas to openpyxl due to the DeprecationWarning in Pandas being cumbersome. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/5d942bace8417bb973441b360a0ec31d77d81e24)

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- Added `=` to the prefix for valid cstag recognition when there is an `n` in inversion. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/747ff3ece221a8c1e4f1ba1b696c4751618b4992)

- Modified the io.load_from_csv function to trim spaces before and after each field, addressing an error caused by spaces in batch.csv. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/f5d49230f8ebd37061a27d6767d3c1954b8f8576)

## ‚õîÔ∏è Deprecated

- Removed `reads_all.csv`. This CSV file, which showed the allele for each read, is no longer reported due to its limited usefulness and because the same information can be obtained from the BAM file.

<summary> v0.4.0 (2024-01-20) </summary>

## üí• Breaking

+ Changed the input from a path to a FASTQ file to **a path to a directory**: The output of Guppy is now stored in multiple FASTQ files under the `barcodeXX/` directory. Previously, it was necessary to combine the FASTQ files in the `barcodeXX/` directory into one and specify it as an argument. With this revision, it is now possible to directly specify the `barcodeXX` directory, allowing users to seamlessly proceed to DAJIN2 analysis after Guppy processing.
[Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/d35ce6f89278d0361cc2b5b30fecfabbc66aa1c4)

## üìù Documentation

## üöÄ New Features

+ Apple Silicon (ARM64) supoorts. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/435bab6c56cb2172601d4b37488850fe48046f9c)

+ Changed the definition of the minor allele from a read number of less than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 5. This is based on the assumption that one sample contains 1000 reads, where 0.5% corresponds to 5 reads. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/80a3ddcf7cac3eed2bcc76b88ea534873af4dd90)


## üîß Update

+ Update `preprocess.insertion_to_fasta` to facilitate the discrimination of Insertion alleles, the Reference for Insertion alleles has been saved in FASTA/HTML directory. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/5899543077f0398863b6316d8c3e953b5f125f55)

+ Update `insertions_to_fasta.extract_enriched_insertions`: Previously, it calculated the presence ratio of insertion alleles separately for samples and controls, filtering at 0.5%. However, due to a threshold issue, some control insertions were narrowly missing the threshold, resulting in them being incorrectly identified as sample-specific insertions. To rectify this, the algorithm now clusters samples and controls together, excluding clusters where both types are mixed. This modification allows for the extraction of sample-specific insertion alleles. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/65030daba7c56a6c3f3f685832084b71c6b2e1c3)

+ Updated `preprocess.insertions_to_fasta.count_insertions` of the counting method to treat similar insertions as identical. Previously, the same insertion was erroneously counted as different ones due to sequence errors. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/7bc18f486253e876d51a296f64909e1c73114e79)

+ Updated `preprocess.insertions_to_fasta.merge_similar_insertions`: Previously, clustering was done using MiniBatchKMeans, but this method had an issue where it excessively clustered when only highly similar insertion sequences existed. Therefore, a strategy similar to `extract_enriched_insertions` was adopted, changing the algorithm to one that mixes with a uniform distribution of random scores before clustering. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/fb7074cab9d9e4e3d293cb5487a3525a5faf06fd)

+ Added `preprocess.insertions_to_fasta.clustering_insertions`: Combined the clustering methods used in `extract_enriched_insertions` and `merge_similar_insertions` into a common function. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/6d7ff79351c5f60320b2269accb0e3bc159fdd5b)


+ Moved the `call_sequence` function to the `cssplits_handler` module. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/ef5b0bf41ab33a7e8d06d33fe7fa6c27a443742a)

## üêõ Bug Fixes

+ Debug `clustering.merge_labels` to be able to correctly revert minor labels back to parent labels. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/8127a94e042328b87e456d3748ebea66a845ba1a)


+ Updated `utils.input_validator.validate_genome_and_fetch_urls` to obtain `available_server` more explicitly. Previously, it relied on HTTP response codes, but there were instances where the UCSC Genome Browser showed a normal (200) response while internally being in error. Therefore, with this change, a more explicit method is employed by searching for specific keywords present in the normal HTML, to determine if the server is functioning correctly. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/24a02591e8a146030012dbf564e4b6cd98d42139)

+ Added `config.reset_logging` to reset the logging configuration. Previously, when batch processing multiple experiment IDs (names), a bug existed where the log settings from previous experiments remained, and the log file name was not updated. However, with this change, log files are now created for each experiment ID. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/b83669c627710a5e358f934212e961373203ee52)

+ Debugged `core.py`: Modified the specification of `paths_predefined_fasta` to accept input from user-entered ALLELE data. Previously, it accepted fasta files stored in the fasta directory. However, this approach had a bug where fasta files left over from a previously aborted run (which included newly created insertions) were treated as predefined. This resulted in new insertions being incorrectly categorized as predefined. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/6dd9247f010eb6168157ae9236a634efcfb84a5f)

## üöÄ Update

### Preprocess

- Updated `input_validator.py`: The UCSC Blat server sometimes returns a 200 HTTP status code even when an error occurs. In such cases, "Very Early Error" is indicated in the title. Therefore, we have made it so that it returns False in those situations. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/4ad9c9ef8bd963a6e20c1721480aed0fe7922760)

- Simplified `homopolymer_handler.py` for error detection using cosine similarity. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/21c2596805c36074f360285600e60ee76b948908)

- Updated `mutation_extractor.py` to use cosine similarity to filter dissimilar loci. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/c9f5aa7b48581e58d99fe8c31275c422756aa9f1)

- Updated the `mutation_extractor.identify_dissimilar_loci` so that it unconditionally returns True if the 'sample' shows more than 5% variation compared to the 'control'. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/0cbec5217fdfba6886979eb86cf970b587e83e5f)

- Added `preprocess.midsv_caller.convert_consecutive_indels_to_match`: Due to alignment errors, instances where a true match is mistakenly replaced with "insertion following a deletion" are corrected. For example, "=C,=T" mistakenly replaced by "-C,+C|=T" is reverted back to "=C,=T". [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/69c56fa904ef847dc5b0e2dcdb90303409412d0f)

### Classification

- Added `allele_merger.merge_minor_alleles` to reclassify alleles with fewer than 10 reads to suppress excessive subdivision of alleles. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/b0752960def313e237ccf7d44542f9810cad0c00)

### Clustering

- Added the function `merge_minor_cluster` to revert labels clustered with fewer than 10 reads back to the previous labels to suppress excessive subdivision of alleles. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/4bd9f7dd806d192475d8d4f20c1e50c37281d64e)

- Updated `generate_mutation_kmers` to consider indices not registered in mutation_loci as mutations by replacing them with "@". For example, "=G,=C,-C" and "=G,=G,=C" become "@,@,@" in both cases, making them the same and ensuring they do not affect clustering. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/9eefaaa1a9be3922b60655292c0a310e0f5fc76d)

### Consensus

- Implemented `LocalOutlierFactor` to filter abnormal control reads. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/94c48da01fc039902c97a23ddea47dd5f2b42ab4)
