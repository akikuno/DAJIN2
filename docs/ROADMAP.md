# Development Logs of DAJIN2

-------------

# v0.3.5 (2023-12-23)

## üìù Documentation

+ [x] Added `ROADMAP.md` to track the progress of the project [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/cf05d3e5c9b1d3ee806d66c9c1d9f8079863e312)
+ [x] Added *Prerequisites* section to README.md [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/7d5a3cd8305f9d414a492f5223d5dbec7399aa46)

## üöÄ Features

### Preprocessing

+ [x] Updated `homopolymer_handler.get_counts_homopolymer` to change to count mutations in homopolymer regions considering only the control [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/e5d061750c66bdc225fcddfae6e2d2a12fe49ad2)

### Clustering

+ [x] Changed clustering algorithm from KMeans to BisectingKMeans to handle larger dataset [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/7733524625de77c814496791a461eb7bbff54d0e)

### Consensus

+ [x] Added `convert_consecutive_indels_to_match` to offset the effect when the same base insertion/deletion occurs consecutively [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/a678615b4ffeeefdc9509f49651698281b1aff22)

+ [x] Added `similarity_searcher.py` to extract control reads resembling the consensus sequence, thereby enhancing the accuracy of detecting sample-specific mutations. [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/98a8a45e13835502f7dea2622274da81bbbc3ba3)

+ [x] Changed the method in `clust_formatter.get_thresholds`` to dynamically define the thresholds for ignoring mutations, instead of using fixed values.[Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/2249d1601ad619a7db0fcc9ebf79d63f8dcf164b)
+ [x] Removed code that was previously commented out [Commit Detail](https://github.com/akikuno/DAJIN2/commit/2249d1601ad619a7db0fcc9ebf79d63f8dcf164b)

## üêõ Bug Fixes
