# Frequently Asked Questions

## How many reads are necessary?

Currently, we recommend **at least 1,000 reads**. With 1,000 reads, it is possible to detect point mutation alleles with a frequency of 1%, ensuring high-precision analysis. However, if the target is an indel of more than a few tens of bases, or if the expected allele frequency is 5% or higher, detection is possible with fewer reads (~500 reads).
