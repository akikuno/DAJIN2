# Sample infomation

# Design

- Substitution of Exon 1 at *Tyr*
- Expected substition: Tyr c.230G>T (mm39 chr7:87142329-87142330)
- Mouse information: [Tyrc-Brd](https://www.informatics.jax.org/allele/MGI:3640303)

## Samples

- Three samples with different percentages of point mutation alleles present
    - `tyr_c230gt_01.fq.gz` : 1% of targetted substition, 99% of wild-type allele
    - `tyr_c230gt_10.fq.gz` : 10% of targetted substition, 90% of wild-type allele
    - `tyr_c230gt_50.fq.gz` : 50% of targetted substition, 50% of wild-type allele

- 5,000 reads/sample

## Control

- `tyr_control.fq.gz`
    - wild-type control
    - 5,000 reads
